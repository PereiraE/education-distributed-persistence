# Distributed persistance

## Content

This repository contains exercises in the module labs. The exercices are mostly cloze code (code you have to filling
with the correct answer). But you also have code to activate and for which you should observe interactions once run.

In the code, when you see symbols like `??` or `???`, you should replace them with your answer. Sometimes, you will be
helped with unit tests. Sometimes, you will `check` instructions, implicitly asking you to modify the code.

Any time you see a call to `exercise_ignore`, convert it to a call to `exercise` and rerun the part.
